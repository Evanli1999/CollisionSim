# CollisionSim
Collision Simulations made for an AP Physics project. This simulation will track the position, compression, force, acceleration...etc of multiple elastic spheres, outputting a spreadsheet of said parameters at every dynamic timeframe. The program is also capable of tracking multiple rotating objects.
